variables to keep track of:
    prio 1:
    num of simulations
    depth of simulations
    cards played
    card in round
    current trick
    tricks played

    prio 2:
    player not having a suit
    team that started round
    points still available
    card points
    highest card for each suit

    prio 3:
    flexible depth

important:
    opponent heuristics
        dictates on how accuarte our simulations are
        no concrete plan yet(maybe risky/ risk averse?)
    
    Multiple monte bots to play against each other and show improvements
    show statistic between choosing trick or not in points
    
    Stats for how many games got won/ lost, win + points, loss - points

monte carlo content:
    prio 1
    evaluate card strength
    simulate opponent hand
        takes into consideration opponents not having a suit
    simulate opponent play

    prio 2
    evaluate for team win(round -> points)

    prio 3
    point and win modifier for plays
    different approaches for who starts round
    if all are low win chance give low card that team mate have high suit in

point and win modifier for plays:
    has to stil be defined how it would look
    for how many points do we ignore the win
    or gamble on it

Step 1:
    monte carlo depth 1
    measure speed and competence

step 2:
    monte carlo depth 2
    
step 3:
    monte carlo depth 3
